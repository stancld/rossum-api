    EDIT
        Created after editing annotation in user interface (rotation or split of the document).

        Represents the state that one or more documents are attachments to another document.

    DUPLICATE
        Created after importing the same document that already exists in Rossum for current
        organization. If duplicate relation already exists then corresponding annotation is
        added to existing relation. ``key`` is set to MD5 hash of document content.
